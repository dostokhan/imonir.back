updated: 10 jun, 2018


### Why ?
For a certainty an editor which optimises writing, editing, reviewing coding workflow saves a lot of time and energy over time. So Any editor chosen must have these features that satisfies me.
1. Git(any VCS) aware.
* Commit without leaving the editor.
* See changes to current file or any files in the project from last commit.
*
